Code scraper for Mturk

Code used to pick up hits on Amazon mturk
Use with pandacrazy to keep track of hits obtained
Plug code straight into console

there might be memory issues, just reopen browser to reset code
Code might deactivate randomly, just initiate it again
also must manually maintain blacklist

Unprofessional code, coded by a rookie.  Use at own risk.  But it does work
